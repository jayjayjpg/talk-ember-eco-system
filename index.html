                                  released synchronously with Ember.js + Ember-Data ~ 6 weeks
                                  release cycle will be around roughly every six weeks to make constant deprecation of
                                  old features and easy migrations of your projects possible - projects won't break
                                  until you ignored the deprecation warnings for a dozen of minor releases this way. 
                                  More about safe upgrading and helpful tools for that later
                                  If you now want to get started with ember you can get started as follows
                                  - install ember cli globally
                                  if you are a node package management purist and are actually not using it already you will also 
                                  have to install bower globally
